This repository contains notebooks where different methods in Natural Language Processing have been used to build a classification model for predicting whether a tweet is actually about real disaster or not. The performace of these different strageries are also discussed and compared in detail. The different methods implemented are:

1. Training machine learning models on features engineerd using data analysis, text processing and sentiment analysis.
2. Training machine learning models on data trnasformed into Vector Space Model along with tf-idf weighing.
3. Training deep learning language models on processed(embedded) text data.

Libraries used:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotib
- nltk
- scikit-learn
